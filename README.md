### Claim Conductor Model/Demo

Claim conductor can be found running at: http://54.193.231.155:3000/
Please note that:
- This is running in a public nano ec2 instance; caps on memory will be very low
- This has not been configured to run over HTTPS and thus must be run unsecurely over HTTP. Check your browser settings if the page does not load, though it should load fine so long as the url specifies http:// vs https://.

Happy assessing! Will add notes here as they become relevant.
